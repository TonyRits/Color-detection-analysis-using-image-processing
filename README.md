Color Detection Analysis Using Image Processing
Project Overview

Color Detection Analysis Using Image Processing
A Python-powered system that analyzes images and real-time webcam feeds to detect dominant colors using
OpenCV, YOLO, and other libraries.It also performs object detection on both images and videos. It includes
functionalities for medical applications.

Integrated image processing techniques with deep learning models for object detection and color
detection,enhancing visualization of data results and self-learning capabilities.
