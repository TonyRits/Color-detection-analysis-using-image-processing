Color Detection Analysis Using Image Processing
Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting and identifying colors in images using image processing techniques. By converting images into suitable color spaces and applying thresholding, the system accurately detects specific colors present in an image or video stream.

Objectives

Detect specific colors in an image or live video

Apply image processing techniques for color segmentation

Implement real-time color detection

Technologies Used

Python

OpenCV

NumPy

Methodology

Capture image or video input

Convert image from RGB/BGR to HSV color space

Apply color thresholding and masking

Detect contours of colored regions

Display detected colors with bounding boxes
